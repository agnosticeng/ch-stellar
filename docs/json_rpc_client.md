# JSON-RPC Client

All functions that make RPC calls to Stellar RPC nodes use the same in-house JSON-RPC client.

By default, this client automatically batches calls to nodes, as described in JSON-RPC specification. Since ClickHouse processes UDFs (User-Defined Functions) with full blocks of data, batching is naturally aligned with ClickHouse’s execution model, improving efficiency and reducing RPC overhead.

## Passing options

The client offers various configurable options, which can be set through the use of URL hash parameters, e.g.:

```
https://rpc.lightsail.network/#max-batch-size=50&fail-on-error=true
```

### Configuration Options

| URL Hash Parameter | Type | Default Value | Description |
| - | - | - | - |
|                              | string   | *(required)*           | The JSON-RPC endpoint for sending calls. |
| `max-batch-size`             | int64    | `200`                  | Maximum number of calls per batch. |
| `max-concurrent-requests`    | int64    | `5`                    | Maximum number of concurrent outgoing RPC calls. |
| `disable-batch`              | bool     | `false`                | Disables batching, sending one RPC request per row instead. |
| `fail-on-error`              | bool     | `false`                | Fails the entire batch if at least one RPC call encounters an error. |
| `fail-on-null`               | bool     | `false`                | Fails the batch if any RPC call returns a `null` response. |
| `retry-initial-interval`     | duration | `0.5s`                 | The initial interval of the exponential backoff. |
| `retry-randomization-factor` | float64  | `0.5`                  | The randomizatiob factor of the exponential backoff. |
| `retry-multiplier`           | float64  | `1.5`                  | The multiplier of the exponential backoff. |
| `retry-max-interval`         | duration | `60s`                  | The max interval of the exponential backoff. |
| `retry-max-elapsed-time`     | duration | `300s`                 | The max elapsed time of the exponential backoff. |
| `retry-max-tries`            | uint     | `20`                   | The max number of tries of the exponential backoff. |
